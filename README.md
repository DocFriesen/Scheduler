# Scheduler App

A minimalist interactive scheduler to help you reach your goals. 

I aim to build an app to structure my days based on interchangeable blocks, with metacognitive prompts to prompt better productivity.

I also want to contextualize the schedule with higher level goals, so that each activity is related to long term goals.

Some components to build:

- User profile with Goal setting pathway
- Time view on a daily, weekly, monthly grid
- Customizable Blocks that relate to Goals
- Dragging functionality to make goal alignment simple and easy
