# Scheduler App

A web app for interactive scheduling

I aim to build an app to structure my days based on interchangeable blocks, with metacognitive prompts to prompt better productivity.

I also want to contextualize the schedule with higher level goals, so that each activity is related to long term goals.

Some components to build:

User profile with goal setting
Time view on a daily, weekly, monthly grid
Customizable blocks
Block Planning and Block Review prompts
